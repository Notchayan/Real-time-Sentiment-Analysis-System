# Streamlit Tutorial using Python

## Overview

This project provides a tutorial on how to use Streamlit, an open-source Python framework, to create and deploy web applications for machine learning models. The tutorial focuses on building a simple real-time sentiment analysis system using Python and deploying it as a web app with Streamlit.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The application can analyze user input and determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Users can input text, and the app provides instant feedback on the sentiment.
- **Easy Deployment**: Streamlit makes it easy to turn Python scripts into web applications without needing extensive web development knowledge.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install the libraries individually:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit nltk
Download NLTK Data:

Ensure the vader_lexicon is downloaded for sentiment analysis:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run filename.py
This will open the application in your default web browser.

Usage
Input: Enter text to rate services in the provided text input box.
Output: The application will display whether the input sentiment is "Positive" or "Negative."
